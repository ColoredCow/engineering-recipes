# Code Review Guidelines

These guidelines are used by Claude to align feedback with project expectations.

## Focus areas

- Readability and maintainability
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity
- Performance impact on critical user flows
- Database query efficiency
- Security implications (auth, payments, PII)

## Review tone

- Be constructive
- Prefer suggestions over rewrites
- Call out risks clearly
- Avoid stylistic nitpicking unless it affects clarity or safety
